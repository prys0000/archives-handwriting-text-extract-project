# archives-textract

The objective of this project is to create a versatile text extraction and cleaning tool. It leverages the features provided by [**Amazon Textract**](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/?nc2=type_a) and offers customizable processes. This flexibility allows the tool to align with specific repository or project requirements, as well as facilitate **local file processing**.

Both local and AWS codes extract text from **handwritten** documents, performs text cleaning operations and saves the extracted and cleaned text to the ***existing metadata templates used by the repository***.

Extracting text from handwritten documents and exporting it to metadata worksheets can significantly enhance the efficiency of processing archival collections. Here's how:

**1. Time Efficiency:**

* Handwritten documents are often time-consuming to transcribe manually. Automated text extraction eliminates the need for manual transcription, saving a significant amount of time.

**2. Bulk Processing:**

* Automation enables bulk processing, allowing you to extract text from ***multiple documents simultaneously***.

**3. Consistent Metadata:**

* Metadata worksheets provide a structured format for storing extracted text. This consistency ensures ***uniformity across the collection's metadata***, making it easier to manage and search for specific information.

**4. Quick Search and Retrieval:**

* Having text extracted and stored in metadata worksheets enables powerful **search capabilities**. Researchers can quickly search for keywords or phrases across the collection, speeding up the retrieval of relevant documents.

**5. Enhanced Accessibility:**

* ***Researchers who may struggle with reading handwriting can now access and understand the content easily.***

**6. Efficient Review:**

* Archivists can quickly ***scan the extracted text*** for keywords, names, or dates to determine the document's significance without reading every page.

**7. Cross-Collection Analysis:**

* Extracted text can be used for ***cross-collection analysis***. Researchers can analyze trends, topics, and themes across different collections, leading to deeper insights.

**8. Data Enrichment:**

* Extracted text can be enriched with metadata such as ***dates, author names, and locations***. This additional information enhances the context of the documents and aids in categorization.

**9. Preservation of Originals:**

* Automated extraction ***reduces the need to handle fragile original documents frequently***. Preserving the physical documents is crucial for their long-term preservation.

**10. Scalability:**

* As archival collections grow, automation ensures that the process remains ***scalable without exponentially increasing the workload***.

**11. Reduced Human Error:**

* Automated extraction ***reduces the likelihood of transcription errors*** associated with manual processing.

**12. Task Allocation:**

* Archivists and researchers can focus on higher-level tasks such as ***analysis, interpretation, and curatorial work*** rather than spending extensive time on transcription.

***By integrating text extraction and metadata creation, archival processing becomes more streamlined, accessible, and conducive to meaningful research. Automation empowers archivists to manage and leverage archival content more effectively, ultimately enhancing the value and impact of the collection.***
