README
The objective of this project is to develop a text extraction and cleaning tool that utilizes the capabilities of Amazon Textract and RapidMiner. The code extracts text from documents stored in an AWS S3 bucket, performs text cleaning operations using RapidMiner, and saves the extracted and cleaned text to Excel files. By automating the text extraction and cleaning processes, this project enables efficient handling of large-scale collections of documents. The use of Amazon Textract and RapidMiner allows for reliable and accurate extraction and cleaning of text from various document formats. The resulting system provides a streamlined and scalable solution for processing textual data, which can be valuable for applications such as data analysis, information retrieval, and natural language processing.
By leveraging Amazon Textract for extraction and RapidMiner for cleaning, it provides a comprehensive solution for processing textual data. The extracted and cleaned text can be further utilized for various applications, such as data analysis, natural language processing, and information retrieval.
