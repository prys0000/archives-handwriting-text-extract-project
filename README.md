# archives-textract

The objective of this project is to create a versatile text extraction and cleaning tool. It leverages the features provided by [**Amazon Textract**](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/?nc2=type_a) and offers customizable processes. This flexibility allows the tool to align with specific repository or project requirements, as well as facilitate **local file processing**.

The code extracts text from documents stored in an AWS S3 bucket, performs text cleaning operations and saves the extracted and cleaned text to the existing metadata templates used by the repository. 

By automating the text extraction and cleaning processes, this project enables efficient handling of large-scale collections of documents, which can include various file formats such as PDFs, images, or other formats that contain text, whether it's handwritten or typed. 

The use of the scripts provide streamlined and scalable solutions for processing textual data, which can be valuable for applications such as data analysis, information retrieval, and natural language processing.
