This code performs the following tasks:

Import necessary libraries: The code imports various libraries required for different tasks, such as boto3 for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS), re for regular expression operations, nltk for natural language processing tasks, SpellChecker for spell checking, time for time-related operations, pandas for data manipulation, and subprocess for running external commands.

Read AWS credentials and S3 bucket name: The code reads the AWS credentials and S3 bucket name from a file named "credentials.txt". It searches for specific lines in the file and extracts the values for AWS access key ID, AWS secret access key, and S3 bucket name.

Check the validity of credentials: The code checks if the extracted AWS credentials and S3 bucket name are not None. If any of them is None, it raises a ValueError indicating invalid credentials.

Set AWS region and create clients: The code sets the AWS region to "us-east-1" and creates clients for Amazon Textract and Amazon S3 using the boto3 library.

Initialize NLTK and SpellChecker: The code downloads necessary NLTK data, specifically the "punkt" tokenizer and "stopwords". It also initializes a SpellChecker object for spell checking.

Retrieve objects from the S3 bucket: The code uses the S3 client to list objects in the specified S3 bucket.

Extract text using Amazon Textract: For each object in the bucket, the code calls Amazon Textract to start a document analysis job. It retrieves the JobId for the job and polls until the job status indicates completion. Once the job succeeds, it extracts the text from the analyzed blocks and appends the file title and text to the data list.

Create a DataFrame and save to Excel: The code creates a pandas DataFrame from the extracted text data and saves it to an Excel file named "extracted_text.xlsx".

Perform text cleaning using RapidMiner: The code specifies the paths to the RapidMiner executable and the RapidMiner process file (.rmp). It uses subprocess.run() to execute RapidMiner with the specified arguments, including the input and output Excel file paths.

Print completion messages: The code prints messages indicating the successful extraction and cleaning of text, along with the respective file paths where the extracted and cleaned text are saved.

Overall, the code retrieves text from objects in an S3 bucket using Amazon Textract, saves the extracted text to an Excel file, and then performs text cleaning using RapidMiner.
